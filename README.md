Builds 32-bit MUMPS and statically links dependent libraries \
-> to get the 64-bit variant please checkout branch **mumps-64**

Recipe tested with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, MATLAB 2024b
- dependencies:\
openblas 0.3.26 \
mumps    5.6.2 \
metis    5.1.0 \
scotch   7.0.3

- package requirements:
bison flex zlib-dev gfortran

- compiler requirements: \
gcc-9 gfortran-9 \
https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/support/sysreq/files/system-requirements-release-2021b-supported-compilers.pdf \
may use update-alternatives under Linux: \
https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-switch-between-multiple-gcc-and-g-compiler-versions-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa \

- prepend before calling MATLAB: \
```export MATLABPATH="<Path-to-mex-files>":<sth-like-/usr/local/MATLAB>"```

Simply execute ```make_...``` in order (and hope that it will also work as simple ;-)
