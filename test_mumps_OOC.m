% Run mumps out-of-core (OOC) to reuse factorizations within parfor.
%
% See mumps userguide chpt. 5.20
%
% Issue: MATLAB workers in a parfor loop do not share memory, hence objects
% like decomposition/MUMPS cannot be directly broadcasted to workers
% -> these objects in parts only exist in memory
% Fix: Mumps factorization needs to be stored to disc (serialized) and read
% by the worker (deserialized) using the mumps-own OOC
%
% TODO: For more appropriate timing, parallel processes should pinned on
%       the multiple amount of CPUs compared to serial evaluation.
